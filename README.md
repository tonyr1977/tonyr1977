- I’m currently working on creating a website using CSS and Javascript
- I’m currently learning Javascript
- I’m am currently taking SEP at HSTAT
- I’m looking for help with learning web design
- Ask me about nothing. Absolutely nothing because if I was to tell you anything it will probably be wrong.
- How to reach me. You don't. Unless I personally know you otherwise don't even try to contact me.
- Pronouns: He, Him, His
- Fun fact: I'm currently still trying to do a project (in which I stopped for a while to get used to school) with 2 friends and it will be about anti malware, and trojan prevention because businesses lose billion each year for every successful attack on their company. Also if I don't have my coffee or breakfast yet, don't talk to me otherwise unless getting ending up in my coffee machine is in your bucket list :)... jk.
